          <a>Dylan, a single parent, is 15 years old and her world is in shambles: she is always at a loss for words with her mother, she is constantly teased by her classmates at school, and her only close friend has left because she changed schools. Dylan was devastated by all of this.
            She decides to visit her father, whom she hasn't seen for a long time, but on the way there is a traffic accident. After she desperately climbs out of the train wreckage, she is shocked to find that she seems to be the only survivor, and in front of her, there is a wasteland. At this moment, Dylan sees the figure of a boy on a hillside not far away. The boy takes her away from the scene of the accident. However, Dylan soon realised that the boy was not a passer-by who appeared by chance; he seemed to be waiting here on purpose. Fate, from the moment they meet, takes an unforeseen turn ......</a>
