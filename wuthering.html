          <a>Wuthering Heights depicts the Gypsy outcast Hitchcock Kliff who, after being adopted by the old master of the hill, goes out to make his fortune because he is overwhelmed by humiliation and frustrated in his love affairs. Upon his return, he discovers that his girlfriend, Catherine, has married the landowner, Linton, which then gives rise to the story of revenge against the landowner and his children. The whole piece is full of strong anti-oppression, freedom of the spirit of struggle, and always shrouded in bizarre, tense, romantic artistic atmosphere. The work was once called a naive fantasy of a young woman writer detached from reality, but combined with the fierce class struggle in the region it describes and the social phenomena of the time in Britain, it was soon highly affirmed by the critics and warmly welcomed by the majority of readers.</a>
